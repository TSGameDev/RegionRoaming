THIS IS CURRENTLY NOT A COMPLETED/USEABLE PROJECT

# Region Roaming
This is a tool I created for my college course and is a verticle slice of a larger tool proposal. I do plan to make that tool in full in the future and, might, update this to contain a link to it. The tool should stille work fine and provide a useful and pleasant experience.

## What does it do?
Region Roaming provides an easy way to design a region, its in the name, and then get a random point within that region from a simple function call. This is great for, once again in the name, AI Roaming. It currently supports Unity navmesh, terrain Raycast Vector3s if the AI doesn't use unity navmeshes and a flight randomiser.

In addition to this there is a small mathmatical class containing the logic used to get this random positions, plus triangulation and Triangle.NET library.

## Instalation
[To be added when the tool is fully complete].

## Bugs
If there are any bugs within this tool feel free to shoot them at me at twitter https://twitter.com/TSGame_Dev. Do keep in mind this is a college product and I don't plan to keep this updated as I want to make the tool in full at a later date.
